# Bike-Share-Prediction

This case study is about a bike rental shop. They want to predict the demand of bikes at any given hour of the day, so that, they can arrange for sufficient number of bike for the customers.

# Dataset Description
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

They have shared the hourly rental data for last two years.

Your task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the count of bikes rented at a given hour of the day.

In below case study I will discuss the step by step approach to create a Machine Learning predictive model in such scenarios.

You can use this flow as a template to solve any supervised ML Regression problem!

The flow of the case study is as below:

Reading the data in python

Defining the problem statement

Identifying the Target variable

Looking at the distribution of Target variable

Basic Data exploration

Rejecting useless columns

Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)

Feature Selection based on data distribution

Outlier treatment

Missing Values treatment

Visual correlation analysis

Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)

Converting data to numeric for ML

Sampling and K-fold cross validation

Trying multiple Regression algorithms

Selecting the best Model

Deploying the best model in production.

# Flask

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the community that make adding new functionality easy.

# Installation of Flask

Install and update using pip:

$ pip install -U Flask
